# TODO:
- Check Camera
- Check uniform scale factor for spot light
1-(scaleFactor(1/1-edge))
to scale a value from a range to another range, i.e, scale .3 from range [0,1] to [0,2]
- Understand model import process (i.e. constructing vertices list and indices list, locating and creating textures and materials.)
